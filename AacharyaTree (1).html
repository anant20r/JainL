                  <div class="lead">

                    <p>Aacharya Aadi Sagar Ji Maharaj was a very prominent saint of present era, from Digamber tradition. After the salvation of Mahavir Swami around 2600 years ago, there was a rich tradition of Digamber saints, who left household life to purify their soul from karma and proceed towards Moksha. The tradition continued with no obstacles till 1300 AD, and then there was almost a disappearance of this tradition, because of attacks by the Muslims and the British.<br>The worship of saints is an essential for Jain householders because it gives them inspiration to become like them, and also accelerates them in their spiritual upliftment. Acharya Aadi Sagar Maharaj Ji revived the Digamber saints tradition in 19th Century.<br><br><br><strong>Birth : Bhadra Pada Shukla 4, Vikram Sanvat 1923 Thursday<br>Birth Place: Ankali (Maharashtra)<br>Birth Name : Shivagaura Patil<br>Mothers Name : Akka Bai<br>Fatherâ€™s Name : Sidha Goura Patil<br>Place of Muni Diksha : Kunthalgiri<br>Acharya Pada: JaiSinghpur, Maharashtra, Jyeshtha Panchami Shukla, Vikram Samvat 1972<br>Samadhi : Udgaav (Kunjvan), Falgun Krishna 13, Vi Sa 2001<br></strong> <br><br><br>Maharaj Ji was born in 1809 in a small town Ankli in Karnataka state in India. Karnataka is in the south of India. These areas have a rich tradition of Digamber saints and a remarkable history for Jains. Maharaj Ji was religious from birth and the family business was landlord ship. His mother died when he was only 15 years old and his father died when he was 27 years old. These tragic events and his religious inclinations became reasons for his non-attachment towards the world. He used to follow the six essentials as a householder At age 40, he became Kshullak.( A Kshullak is one who leaves household life, uses only two pairs of clothes, eats once daily, and wonders from one place to another like a saint). After become Kshullak Ji, he started further progressing in his spiritual development.<br>At the age of 47 years he took Muni diksha, and gave up all his belongings including clothes. He was a great ascetic. He used to eat food once a week and completely fast for the rest 6 days. He used to do his Saadhna in forests. He used to take only one food item in his diet- in the mango season he used to take only mango juice in his diet. He used to stay in caves in the jungle for his meditation. Once a lion came while he was meditating, and still it did not bother him- the lion went away. In 1858 he was given the Acharya post in JaiSinghpur village. I<br></p>
